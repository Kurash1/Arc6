# Arc6

**Arc6** is a scripting language designed to simplify and enhance the process of modding Paradox Interactive games, particularly *Europa Universalis IV* (EU4). The language provides robust compile-time operations that address the limitations of runtime modding in these games, making it easier to develop and maintain complex mods.

Arc6 is not intended to be used as a standalone language but as a foundational tool for building frameworks tailored to specific games. For instance, **Valley** is an Arc6 framework currently in development that targets EU4 modding.

## Features

- **Support for Paradox Syntax**  
  Arc6 is designed to easily generate the syntax and file structures used by Paradox games.

- **Compile-Time Operations**  
  Powerful compile-time features enable you to automate and simplify modding tasks that are difficult or impossible at runtime.

- **Framework-Friendly**  
  Arc6 is minimalistic by design, providing the core features needed to build more specialized frameworks for different games.

- **Extensible**  
  While Arc6 is bare-bones, itâ€™s built to be extended, allowing the creation of comprehensive tools for specific modding needs.
